- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrafolsr
- 👀 I’m interested in experimental physics, specially organic electronics, but I also enjoy creating and coding new scientific instruments using Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create python libraries and modules that could eventually be useful to other experimental physicists.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that involves controlling lab instruments with python (e.g. pyvisa, pyhton-seabreeze or similar) and potentially even creating some user-friendly GUIs (currently using dash, from plotly).
